 *  -Define the functions for dispute creation (createDispute) and appeal (appeal). Don't forget to store the arbitrated contract and the disputeID (which should be unique, use nbDisputes).
 *  -Define the functions for cost display (arbitrationCost and appealCost).
 *  -Allow giving rulings. For this a function must call arbitrable.rule(disputeID, ruling).
