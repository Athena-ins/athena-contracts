                <h1>Legal Disclaimer</h1>
                <p>Please read the following notification properly before taking part in ATEN token sale. This notice
                    applies to all persons who read this document. Please note this notification may be changed or
                    updated.
                    <br />
                    ATEN token sale is carried out by Athena Ins, a company incorporated and existing under the laws of
                    Santa Fe (hereinafter – the «Seller»). We also draw your attention, that the ATEN Whitepaper
                    (hereinafter – «WP») does not constitute any relations between you (hereinafter – «you» or the
                    «Buyer») and the Seller. Purchasing of ATEN tokens is available only after accepting the Terms of
                    use (hereinafter – «ToU») and Privacy Policy.
                    <br />
                    Purchasing of ATEN tokens does not present an exchange of cryptocurrencies or conventional
                    currencies for any form of ordinary shares of the Seller and the Buyer of ATEN tokens is not
                    entitled to any guaranteed form of dividend. The Buyer is only entitled to certain rights within the
                    ToU. ATEN tokens are not intended to constitute securities in any jurisdiction.
                    <br />
                    WP does not constitute a prospectus or offer document of any sort, and is not intended to constitute
                    an offer of securities or a solicitation for investments in securities in any jurisdiction. WP is
                    posted for information purposes only. The content of WP is not a ﬁnancial promotion. Therefore, none
                    of the content parts of WP should be considered an invitation or inducement to engage in any sort of
                    investment activity. The Buyer should carefully consider and evaluate all risks associated with
                    cryptocurrencies, operations with them, ICO and respective business activities. Before purchase ATEN
                    tokens read carefully all the information set out in this Disclaimer, WP, ToU and Privacy Policy and
                    ensure that you are aware of all potential risks. The section «Risk Statement» details all potential
                    risks that you should consider. We strongly recommend you to seek out independent financial and
                    legal advice before engaging in any sort of business endeavor.
                    <br />
                <h2>Risk Statement</h2>
                No regulatory authority has examined or approved any of the information set out in WP. No such
                action has been or will be taken under the laws, regulatory requirements or rules of any
                jurisdiction. The publication, distribution or dissemination of WP does not imply that the
                applicable laws of any jurisdiction, regulatory requirements, or rules have been complied. To the
                maximum extent permitted by the applicable laws, regulations and rules, the Seller and its
                affiliates and respective officers, employees or agents, in relation to the website (
                https://athena-co.io), ATEN tokens, Athena Ins products and services will not be liable for any
                damages of any kind, including, but not limited to, direct, consequential, incidental, special or
                indirect damages (including but not limited to lost proﬁts, loss of revenue or third party loss
                whether foreseeable or otherwise, trading losses or damages that result from use or loss of use of
                the website, ATEN tokens, Athena Ins products and services). For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller
                expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any
                kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information contained in
                this document, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information, (iii) any action
                resulting therefrom, or (iv) usage or acquisition of Athena Ins products and services, available on
                the website and other electronic platforms.
                <br />
                You confirm and agree that you are not purchasing ATEN tokens for purposes of investment,
                speculation for immediate resale or other ﬁnancial purposes. Some of the statements in WP include
                forward-looking statements which reﬂect the Seller's current views with respect to execution
                roadmap, ﬁnancial performance, business strategy and future plans, both with respect to the Seller
                and the sectors and industries where the Seller operates. Statements which include the words
                «expects», «plans», «believes», «projects», «anticipates», «will», «aims», «may», «would»,
                «could», «continue» and similar statements are of a future or forward-looking nature. All
                forward-looking statements concern the matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly,
                there are or will be important factors that could cause the Sellers’s actual results to differ
                significantly from those indicated in these statements. These factors include but are not limited to
                those described in ToU, which should be read before purchasing of ATEN tokens.
                <br />
                Any forward-looking statements in WP reﬂect the Seller's current views with respect to future events
                and are subject to these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to the Seller's
                operations, results of operations and growth strategy. These forward-looking statements are valid
                only on the date of WP publication. The Buyer should speciﬁcally consider the factors identiﬁed in
                WP and ToU which could cause actual results to differ before making a purchase decision. No
                statement in WP is intended as a proﬁt forecast and no statement in WP should be interpreted to mean
                that the earnings of the Seller for the current or future years would be as may be implied in WP.
